This popular story is about a hare which is known to move quickly and a tortoise which is known to move slower

        The story began when the hare who has won many races proposed a race with the tortoise The hare simply wanted to prove that he was the best and have the satisfaction of beating him

    The tortoise agreed and the race began

    The hare got a head start but became overconfident towards the end of the race His ego made him believe that he could win the race even if he rested for a while

    And so he took a nap right near the finish line

    Meanwhile the tortoise walked slowly but extremely determined and dedicated He did not give up for a second and kept persevering despite the odds not being in his favour

    While the hare was asleep the tortoise crossed the finish line and won the race

    The best part was that the tortoise did not gloat or put the hare down
